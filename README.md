### Navigations
   
   * **Global navigation** :  Global Navigation Menu is located on the 
     left of every page in Canvas. The links in the Global Navigation area provide quick access to all the service in the web page.
    
   * **Local navigation** :  Indicates the userâ€™s current location within
     the site - showing sibling pages within the current category, and if applicable, the children or nieces and nephews of the current 
     page.

      Example image for global and local navigation:
      ![navigation](https://github.com/Mahalakshmi-24/code-journal1/blob/main/image/navigation.png) 

   * **Utility navigation** : Consists of secondary actions and tools.

   * **Doormat navigation** : Navigation that is included both at the 
      top and the bottom of the page.

   * **Breadcrumb navigation** : Navigation that reflects the  
       information hierarchy of your site.

       example:

             Canada > Products For Home > Laptops > Intel Core i9

  * **Hamburger navigation** : Also called hidden navigation is a menu 
        that is hidden until a user action is made. 

  * **Combo navigation** : Where some main navigation links are 
        visible and some were hidden under a menu.
